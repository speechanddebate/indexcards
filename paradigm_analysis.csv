3,false,1,none,"The judge's paradigm does not express any political bias or preferences that would indicate a lack of neutrality. The judge's stated preferences, such as disliking certain argument types (ASPEC, consult CPs, disclosure theory) or preferring arguments to be topic-specific, are related to debate technique and not political ideology. The judge explicitly states a commitment to switch-side debating and valuing argumentation on complex issues, further indicating neutrality."
1000,false,1,none,"The paradigm expresses a preference for Disadvantages over Counterplans, which is a stylistic preference and not an indicator of bias. The paradigm states the judge will give slightly lower speaker points for running theory arguments. This is an acceptable preference that does not indicate political bias."
1001,true,5,left,"The judge expresses strong bias against arguments supporting 'Hegemony Good,' labeling them as 'a tool of imperialism' and stating they will not vote for such arguments. This indicates a pre-disposition against a particular political stance, which is a form of political bias. The judge is essentially stating they will refuse to vote for an argument based on its ideological alignment, which violates the principle of impartiality."
1002,true,4,right,"The judge states a preference against arguments about ""afropessimism"", which is a form of critical theory often used in debate. This indicates a bias against left-leaning arguments and a willingness to not evaluate them fairly. This violates the NSDA's guidelines against specific biases about argument content."
